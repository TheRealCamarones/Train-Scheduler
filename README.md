# Train-Scheduler

A homework assignment for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp. This homework focuses on data persistence using Firebase as well as multiple mathematical functions using momentJS to calculate time.

The user will be able to add customizable trains to dynamically display on the screen. Based on the information the user entered regarding the time of the first train and the frequency with which the train arrives, momentJS will calculate how far away the train is and the time the time the next one will arrive. The data persistence will store the train data in the firebase database and keep a running train schedule for the user.
